    // your class... some visual studio configurations could even 
    // give you a warning saying that the method is private and is 
    // never used.. so you can easily delete those methods thinking
    // that they are never gonna be called, but in reality unity 
    // will call those methods even if they are private.

    // in your methods and I usualy keep them insade a "Unity Messages"
